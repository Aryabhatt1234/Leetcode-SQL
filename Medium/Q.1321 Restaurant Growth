select c1.visited_on, sum(c2.amount) as amount, round(avg(c2.amount),2) as average_amount from
(select visited_on, sum(amount) as amount from Customer group by visited_on) as c1,
(select visited_on, sum(amount) as amount from Customer group by visited_on) as c2
where Datediff(c1.visited_on, c2.visited_on) between 0 and 6
group by c1.visited_on
having count(c1.visited_on) = 7
